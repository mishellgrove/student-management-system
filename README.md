# student-management-system
Student-management-system is a platform developed with java oriented to teachers in order to register students who are having bad 
times due to the hurricane that is hitting the coast of Colombia. The teachers will have the capacity to register students into courses 
that already exist in the platform, there will be a record in which the students are shown their personal data and the courses that they 
are enrolled in. Also teachers can see the grade point average of the students, financial registration and a binary tree sorted by the 
grade point average. Students can be listed according to their last name and code. All students can be found by their code.
